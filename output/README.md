This folder stores all the output results from each R code. The results are organized into different folders, with each replication using a specific random seed $i$ corresponding to the file `i.RData`. The script `resulty_summary.R` in the folder "drawing_figure_table" is used to read the results from this folder and produce the figures and tables in our paper.
